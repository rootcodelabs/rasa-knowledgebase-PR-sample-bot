# Knowledge Base Bot

This example bot is an improved version of knowledgebasebot provided in examples ('https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/'). 

## Whatâ€™s inside this example?

This example contains some training data and the main files needed to build an
assistant on your local machine. The `knowledgebasebot` consists of the following files:

## How to use this example?

rasa train
```
This will store a zipped model file in `models/`.

To pin a specific version of rasa_sdk, replace rasa_sdk folder with rasa_sdk in 'Lib/site-packages/rasa_sdk'


Start the action server by
```
rasa run actions
```

To chat with the bot on the command line, run
